My life is coding and my main goal is to do it the best way possible! 

I have a bachelor in Information Systems by Universidade Federal de Uberl√¢ndia (UFU) and currently I'm a master student in Computer Science at Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais (UFMG) with research area focus in Machine Learning Explainability, focused on Subgroup Discovery (SD). 

Through my life I've worked with multiple, having experience in JAVA, C / C ++, Ruby on Rails, Web Development, SQL with emphasis on DBMS Postgresql as well as Ionic, Cordova and AngularJS / Angular Frameworks and I'm currently working with Machine Learning at Rock Content.
